<!-- Photo montage of ROG background -->

<!-- As brief background, I grew up in Denver, studied cognitive science at Brown, worked in non-profit management in DC before completing my Ph.D. in developmental cognitive neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon. -->
<!-- That's where I met Karen Adolph. -->
<!-- I moved to Penn State after finishing my degree. -->
<!-- I'm an infrastructure guy. -->
<!-- I founded Penn State's imaging center, and I am the co-founder and co-director of Databrary. -->

# Why science must be open

# Psychology is the hardest science

<div class="notes">
I claim that psychology is the hardest science.
</div>

## (Harder than physics)

<div class="notes">
Harder than physics.
I suspect most of the people in this room agree, but in case there are skeptics, let me try to convince you in two simple figures.
</div>

<!-- First year physical science students often face problems like this. Given a mass M, an inclined plane with specified geometry, and a gravitational field, we can predict the future with high precision. What's going to happen next? -->

<!-- Yes, but if we change one element in this equation, the problem becomes immensely harder. What if we change the mass to a mouse? -->

<!-- What happens now? We don't know. -->

<div class="notes">
What happens now? 
We don't have a clue!
Even asking the question seems humorous.

[RIGHT]

Let's examine why it's so hard.

<div class="notes">
Look at the fields where the highest levels of failures to replicate are reported: chemistry, biology, physics & engineering, earth and mineral sciences.
The so-called 'hard' sciences.

I'm not sure, but I think psychology and the social sciences fall into 'other'.
See, we're not doing so badly!

## Openness and transparency make it easier

# Open by design: The MacWhinney legacy

## The central importance of data in scientific advance

## Data must be openly shared

## Data must be organized and shared in common formats

## Discovery requires software tools

## Nurturing research communities

# Inspired by Brian

## Databrary

## Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY)

- What do mothers and infants actually *DO*

We're also creating a large-scale, diverse and rich data set for others to exploit via the Play & Learning Across a Year (PLAY) Project.

- $n=900$ infant/mother dyads, $n=300$ 12-, 18-, and 24-month-olds
- Demographics, health status, media use, temperament
- Modified MB-CDI (interview, video-recorded, English/Spanish item-level equivalents)
- Open protocol, video documentation

The entire PLAY project protocol, including videos of procedures, coding definitions, survey items, etc. is openly shared.
