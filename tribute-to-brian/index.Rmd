## Overview

- The hardest science
- Open by design
- Inspired by Brian

# The hardest science

## Psychology is the hardest science

<div class="notes">
I claim that psychology is the hardest science.
</div>

## (Harder than physics)

<div class="notes">
Harder than physics.
I suspect most of the people in this room agree, but in case there are skeptics, let me try to convince you in two simple figures.
</div>

---

<img src="img/psych-harder-1.jpg" height=500px/>

<div class="notes">
First year physical science students often face problems like this. Given a mass M, an inclined plane with specified geometry, and a gravitational field, we can predict the future with high precision. What's going to happen next?

Yes, but if we change one element in this equation, the problem becomes immensely harder. What if we change the mass to a mouse?
</div>

---

<img src="img/psych-harder-2.jpg" height=500px/>

<!-- What happens now? We don't know. -->

## Why is it so hard?

---

<img src="img/nested-causality-labels.png" height=600px/>

<!-- Perhaps less widely appreciated, the phenomena we study have a nested structure. -->

<div class="notes">
Relatedly, but perhaps less widely appreciated, the phenomena we study have a complex nested structure.

I designed this logo for my lab group to remind me of it.

The science of the mind and behavior collects and integrates evidence from at least four logically separable but mutually embedded realms.
</div>

---

- Body ($B$) within world ($W$)
- Nervous system ($N$) within body ($B$)
- Mind ($M$) within nervous system ($N$)

<div class="notes">

Our bodies are embedded in a world.
Our nervous systems with our bodies.
And our mind within the nervous system.
</div>

---

$\dot{M} = f_{M}(M,N)$

$\dot{N} = f_{N}(N,B)$

$\dot{B} = f_B(B,N,W)$

$\dot{W} = f_W(W,B)$

<div class="notes">
And using the mathematical language of dynamical systems, we can say that these realms are mutually coupled to one another: Changes in the mind are a function of mental and nervous system states, and so forth...

And make no mistake: The mind, brain, and body are non-linear dynamical systems, whether or not we study them that way.

Dynamical systems involve rule-based changes in state variables.
</div>

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
el <- rbind(c("W","B"), c("B","N"), c("N","M"), c("M","N"), c("N","B"), c("B", "W"))
g <- igraph::graph_from_edgelist(el)
g$layout <- igraph::layout_in_circle
plot(g, vertex.size=80, vertex.color="gray", edge.color = "blue")
```

<div class="notes">
The reality is that responses affect the world, responses and world states evoke stimuli, stimuli affects cognition, cognition affects responses, and the cycle repeats.

Non-linear, closed-loop dynamical systems like this require broader and denser data about all of the realms in order to reveal the underlying processes.
Data that can be difficult or expensive to collect.

But even in situations when the data are available, when all of these states are well-known, our current methods have some striking limitations.

<!-- And like the builders of the Tower of Babel after suffering God's wrath, we often struggle to communicate with one another about essential ideas. -->

<div class="notes">
This painting of the Tower of Babel should remind all of us often we're  like the builders after suffering God's wrath: Too often we struggle to communicate with one another about essential concepts and ideas from our distinct subfields.

For example, William James may have said that 'everyone knows what attention is', but I'm not sure we agree.

<!-- The whole elephant -->

<div class="notes">
This figure depicts the classic Hindu myth of the blind men examining an elephant. 
To me, it also reflects the state of psychological science.

We're all studying the elephant, or so we say, but we might easily mistake the trunk for a spear, or the tail for a rope, and so forth.

I want to see the whole elephant!
Don't you?
</div>

## What do to about it?

## Follow a leader

# Open by design

## The language sciences are far ahead of many fields in addressing the problems required to understand language behavior

## Theory is important...

Noam Chomsky

<div class="notes">
Or the cognitive critique of behaviorism articulated most effectively by Noam Chomsky.
</div>

## But data are fundamental

---

- Can children acquire language from the environment?
- Or do they require rich, prior, innate knowledge about the structure of language?

---

- What is the child's language environment ($W$)?
- How does $W$ shape changes in behavior $\dot{B}$
- and by extension, the brain $N$, and the mind $M$?

- Citation required, but not pre-approval of research questions

## Video...

- Captures (& preserves)
- Shows (& helps tell...)
- Expands the scope of inquiry (e.g., words +)
- Provides unparalleled opportunities for reuse

<div class="notes">
Video captures and preserves aspects of behavior that other measures often neglect; it shows what participants do and helps tell the story; it expands the scope of inquiry to include other behaviors; and it provides unparalleled opportunities for reuse.

Video also has unique strengths as research documentation.
