## Overview

- The hardest science
- Open by design
- Inspired by this open science pioneer

# The hardest science

## Psychology is the hardest science

<div class="notes">
I claim that psychology is the hardest science.
</div>

## (Harder than physics)

<div class="notes">
Harder than physics.
I suspect most of the people in this room agree, but in case there are skeptics, let me try to convince you in two simple figures.
</div>

<!-- First year physical science students often face problems like this. Given a mass M, an inclined plane with specified geometry, and a gravitational field, we can predict the future with high precision. What's going to happen next? -->

<!-- Yes, but if we change one element in this equation, the problem becomes immensely harder. What if we change the mass to a mouse? -->

# Open by design

## Data are fundamental

Noam Chomsky

<div class="notes">
Or the cognitive critique of behaviorism articulated most effectively by Noam Chomsky.
</div>

---

- Can children acquire language from the environment?
- Or do they require rich, prior, innate knowledge about the structure of language?

---

- What is the child's language environment?

## Data must be openly shared

---

>"*Why would I share my data? No one would want to see it.*"

A random colleague

---

>"*It's too much work to share.*"

Another random colleague

---

>"*I don't want someone to scoop me or do an analysis I plan to do someday.*"

More random colleagues than you might imagine

- **universalism**: scientific validity is independent of sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants
- **communalism**: common ownership of scientific goods (intellectual property)

---

- **disinterestedness**: scientific institutions benefit a common scientific enterprise, not specific individuals
- **organized skepticism**: claims should be exposed to critical scrutiny before being accepted

> "*...psychologists tend to treat other peoples’ theories like toothbrushes; no self-respecting individual wants to use anyone else’s.*"
<small>
[Mischel, 2009](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/becoming-a-cumulative-science)

> "*The toothbrush culture undermines the building of a genuinely cumulative science, encouraging more parallel play and solo game playing, rather than building on each other’s directly relevant best work.*"

## Data must be organized and shared in common formats

---

- CHAT, extensions for CA, PhonBank, etc...

Data should be...

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**eusable

## Discovery requires powerful tools

## (and tool-building represents an invaluable, important, and high-impace scholarly contribution)
