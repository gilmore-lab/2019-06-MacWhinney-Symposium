# Background

John Kowalksi presented his work on TalkBankDB.
This document describes how to run the demos John presented.

TalkBankDB may be accessed here: <https://sla.talkbank.org/TalkBankDB/>

# Load data from TalkBank

This takes a few moments, so be patient.

```{r load-data-from-web}
loadFromWeb()
```

# Plot word frequency by age

The user needs to provide a target word. 

## Frequency of `the`

We'll use `the` for this example.

```{r plot-freq-the}
freqByAge('the')
```

## Frequency of `mommy`

Here's an example of `mommy`.

```{r plot-freq-mommy}
freqByAge('mommy')
```
